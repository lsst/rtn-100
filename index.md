# 3X3 Multisite Production

```{abstract}
This RTN will describe the process that we have taken to prove that we can process data at multiple sites, bring data back to a central location for calibration, redistribute the out puts and continue the production.  These tests are a proof of concept for multisite production for LSST and are a key first step in understanding the process, and where we need to focus our development.
